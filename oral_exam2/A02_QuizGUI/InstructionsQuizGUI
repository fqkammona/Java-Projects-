Create a quiz using GUI for students in an elementary school using any material you like.
In this problem you are required to have at least 5 questions using different GUI components.
Each question should have at least 4 choices. You are required to use all these components
(in parenthesis is a suggestion for the type of question you could develop with the component):

Checkbox (check all that apply question)
Radio Button (multiple choice)
Dropdown Box (fill in the correct answer)
Lists (classify options into two groups, move to another list similar elements)

To make sure that the students did not cheat, add a statement verifying that the above answers are their own work at
the bottom of the quiz. Ask them to sign the statement by checking an Acknowledgement box.
Provide a submit button for the quiz. Student cannot submit the quiz without signing the statement.
Once they click Submit, your program should present a summary of the quiz showing all of the graded questions
(correct/incorrect/unanswered). The summary should also include their score on the quiz.
